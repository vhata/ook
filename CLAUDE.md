What I'm reading, what I've read, and the bingo card I'm chasing.

## Required reading before substantive work

Three documents form the canonical brief. Read all three before any non-trivial task in this repository.

- **`SPEC.md`** — what this project is.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — how it is built.
- **`PROCESS.md`** — how we work.

The disciplines in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PROCESS.md` are not advisory; they govern the work.

## Patterns established by feedback

Load-bearing patterns the user has explicitly asked for. These live here, in git, so they survive a laptop death.

### Codify new ideas in TODO.md before deciding to implement

When a new feature, polish item, or design idea surfaces in conversation — whether it came from the assistant or the user — the immediate move is an entry in `TODO.md` with the rationale captured at idea-time. _Then_, separately, decide whether to implement now or leave it. Do not ask "should we build this now?" without writing it down first; ideas evaporate, and the in-conversation tradeoff analysis is the most valuable part to preserve. The default is "codify, then defer"; pulling the entry forward is a second decision the user makes deliberately.

<!-- Add patterns as feedback surfaces them. Each pattern: lead with the rule, then a Why: line and a How to apply: line. -->
